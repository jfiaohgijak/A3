      My roles in this project were to help the team to create a wireframe and help to make a prototype for our app Smile Travel. As a user designer I am responsible for creating the visual aspect Smile Travel from the user’s point of view. This means that I'm in charge of making sure that Smile Travel is an easy app to navigate through and in order to complete this I need to make a wireframe. With a wireframe it would help us to identify any problem that a user would run into by creating fake scenarios. From there I would help another team member make the prototype using Protio.io, I was assigned to make a certain part of the app. The part I was assigned to was to create a planning section for the user, where they can organise their flight tickets and accommodation all in one spot. The initial process of making the wireframe and prototype was hard for me because I didn’t have any experience using the application, however after a few YouTube videos and trial and error I was able to get a hang of it.

My role as a project manager throughout the project was to plan and monitor task while also completing various tasks while the rest of the group used their strengths to complete what they wanted and were capable to doing. I believe that with the leadership skills I displayed, this kept the rest of the team motivated in completing the project and that we hadn't given up even if at some points of time we were falling, t think that leading by example, that beginning picking up more tasks for myself to do even during busy week, showed the rest of the team at if we tackled it bit by bit, we could overcome an impossible looking task.

      My role in this project involves helping create the key path scenarios using the wireframes created by Claire and Tommy, and the knowledge I have acquired from the User Cantered Design course. I created a scenario where a user wishes to book a trip using the travel guide and I mapped out all the steps a user would take to perform this task. Together with Andy, we have created three key path scenarios, for booking a trip, for cancelling a trip and for writing a review.  
      <br>I also complied together information from previous assignments to put together the team profile. I compared and analysed the group’s ideal jobs and career paths.

My role in the project was to use the wireframes the UI team created and create pathways for users to use to do the required tasks such as booking a vacation and cancelling a booking. As part of the UI team, I must work with my team members to make sure that users who access our application are able to easily navigate the app without having to be told what to do. The key path are created so we the developers can understand how users will use our application and are able to diagnose and fix any problems that may occur.  We created 3 different key path scenarios that users will use most often on Smile Travel. Creating the scenarios was not too hard as Tommy had already created a prototype. By using what I have learnt in my other classes at RMIT, I was able to create the key path scenes and the wireframes examples with it.

      My roles in this project were to create most of the prototype and designing the testing, as well as doing most of the website. The UI aspect meant that I was responsible to create the prototype from the wireframes. While doing this I had to consider principles and heuristics that can make the program as logical and usable as possible. 
      The Web Designer part meant that I was responsible for creating the website and making it as usable and professional as possible. I did all of the website for this assignment, although it is continued from assignment 2 where other team members contributed some.
