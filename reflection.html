    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Communication and listening were our strong point. As throughout the week we would message the group chat what needed to be done and who will be doing them. Our team also listened very well as many instances there will be a new idea being introduce to the project and other team members would listen carefully and add in any comments, they think that would improve the product.  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Our motivation to do the work wasn’t that high as most of the work was completed within the last 2 week before its dues. So, completing the task sooner would need to improve in the next assessment.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>That we got the prototype to work to an extent. Initially I thought that you would need a lot of experience to know how to make it. But after a few YouTube videos we manage to make one under 1 week.  
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>That by listening what others says, you can learn a lot and work more effectively as a team.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Oliver</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>We did well on terms of communication. Whenever anyone had a question or when certain tasks needed to be done, we would message each other through Facebook messenger. Matthew as the project manager did really well allocating tasks and keeping group members on track and up to date with our current progress through Facebook messenger.  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>The first couple weeks was a bit slow as tasks were not getting done. This may be due to lack of motivation since we have just finished assignment 2 and the group members might have relaxed a bit. What we can improve on next time is maybe start the assignment earlier to reduce stress and rush later. The meetings can be better organised and productive.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One thing that was surprising was that we weren’t as productive with our meetings as we were in assignment 2. I think is due to inconvenient timing with our meetings. We did not have as many meetings for assignment 3 compared to assignment 2. This was surprising because our meetings in assignment 2 was incredibly useful, organised and productive. The meetings in assignment 3 were not necessarily bad, but they were not as good as the ones in assignment 2.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>Groups are extremely exhausting and stressful when working on our own parts to add to the overall project in a remote environment. Working remotely is already very stressful for me but working remotely while knowing that I could let people down is even more stressful.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Communication between group members through this project was the best part of this group project as we were constantly checking in and discussing the next part of the assignment that needed to be completed. The work ethic that was put in by all group members was also great, even at times when we were a bit behind.  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>At the beginning of A3 we started off slow and therefore the end of the assignment was a rush to get everything completed. By starting our assignment earlier, we would have been able to use that time to start everything and then refine our work heading into the final week of the assignment. 
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>One that surprised most of the group was that the photo.io free trial ran out and we were all scared that our work would be deleted.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>By working in a group, a lot of things can be achieved with the right group of people and that everyone has a different way/mindset in completing tasks.  Within a group, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and by utilising everyone strengths and building on those weaknesses, that creates a strong foundation for the project currently being worked on.

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Claire</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>We were able to communicate very well on Facebook Messenger because it is quick and easy so we could ask quick questions or clarifications about things.
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>We struggled to get in the right mindset to work hard on the assignment until quite late so the workload wasn’t equal throughout the time and we did a lot more towards the end. To improve this we could set a stricter work plan or set a goal of how much work we need to complete per week.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br> found it surprising that we were able to be very productive in meetings even when we were all unmotivated about doing actual work.
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>I’ve learned that it’s really helpful to have everyone’s work in a common place, like Microsoft Teams, because you can check where people are up to easily.

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><strong>What went well?</strong>
      <br>Communication within this group was a major positive part of this group, we were able to set out a clear work plan and mostly follow through with it. The group did their tasks, and the meetings were very productive as we discuss on what we had to do for the week  
      <br><strong>What could be imporved?</strong>
      <br>Things that could have been improved was just the start of the assignment as that would have meant the assignment could be completed earlier.   
      <br><strong>At least one thing that was surprising</strong>
      <br>Something surprising that occurred was how we could use stuff from our UX class to help with our project.   
      <br><strong>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</strong>
      <br>That if people can communicate with each other and complete their tasks, then group work with each other will be easier. Therefore, people should always aim to complete their tasks and then communicate any questions they have.
